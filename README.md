# Hospital Management System

This is a hospital management user interface for managing, monitoring and controlling the system in a Hospital. This application is developed in java, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a hospital like adding new patient information, and updating new information, assigning the doctor for patient. It features a familiar and well thought-out, an attractive online user interface, combined with strong searching Insertion and reporting capabilities. The Backend of the project is designed with Java, MySQL for database connectivity and front end using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This was my Java mini-project for third semester UG.
